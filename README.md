# TIN-project

The Raspberry Pi 3 B was equipped with Raspbian as its Operating System. After the installation for the OS is finished, 
remote connection features were set up to ease user jobs to maintain the Raspberry Pi and to create the bridge connection 
between public Wi-Fi access (IIT H Guest) and userâ€™s device.

We have added setup and installation command for the Pi-Hole, Pi-VPN and IDS opencanary. 
We have also attached the config file of IDS opencanary.
